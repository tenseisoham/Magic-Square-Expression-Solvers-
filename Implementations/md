1. The code starts by importing the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python.
2. The `parser` function is defined to parse and extract terms from a given expression. It takes an expression (`expr`) as input and performs the following steps:
    - Replaces the '^' character with an empty string to remove any exponentiation notation.
    - Removes any spaces from the expression.
    - Uses regular expressions to find all matches of terms in the expression. Each term consists of an optional coefficient (including sign), followed by an optional variable term.
    - The function then iterates over the matched terms, extracts the coefficient and variable, and stores them in a list called `parsed_terms`.
    - If the coefficient is not provided, it is set to 1 by default. If the coefficient is preceded by a '-' sign, the coefficient is multiplied by -1.
    - The function returns the list of parsed terms.
3. The `add_polynomials` function takes a list of polynomials as input and combines them into a single polynomial. It performs the following steps:
    - Initializes an empty dictionary called `combined_terms` to store the combined terms of the polynomials.
    - Iterates over each polynomial in the input list.
    - Calls the `parser` function to parse the polynomial and obtain its terms.
    - For each term, it extracts the coefficient and variable.
    - If the variable already exists in `combined_terms`, it adds the coefficient to the existing value. Otherwise, it creates a new entry in `combined_terms` with the variable and coefficient.
    - Finally, it converts the `combined_terms` dictionary into a list of tuples representing the combined polynomial and returns the result.
4. The `extract_columns` function takes a matrix as input and extracts its columns as a list of lists. It iterates over the range of the number of columns and, for each column, iterates over the rows of the matrix to extract the corresponding elements. The resulting columns are stored in a list and returned.
5. The `extract_rows` function takes a matrix as input and extracts its rows as a list of lists. It simply iterates over each row in the matrix and appends it to the list of rows, which is then returned.
6. The `extract_diagonals` function takes a matrix as input and extracts its main and secondary diagonals. It initializes an empty list called `diagonals` to store the diagonals. It first extracts the main diagonal by iterating over the range of the matrix size and appending the corresponding elements to the `diagonal` list. Next, it extracts the secondary diagonal by iterating over the range of the matrix size and appending the elements from the opposite side of each row to the `diagonal` list. Finally, it adds the `diagonal` list to the `diagonals` list and returns it.
7. The `extract_all` function takes a matrix as input and extracts all its columns, rows, and diagonals. It calls the `extract_columns`, `extract_rows`, and `extract_diagonals` functions, and combines their results into a single list, which is returned.
8. The code then defines an example matrix `arr`, which represents a 3x3 matrix of strings.
9. The code calls the `extract_all` function with the `arr` matrix and stores the result in the `result` variable.
10. The code then iterates over each item in the `result` list and prints it. This displays each extracted column, row, and diagonal.
11. The `magic` function is defined to check if the extracted matrix is a magic square.

It takes the `result` list as input and performs the following steps:
- Initializes the `globalsum` variable with the first polynomial from the `result` list (represented as a list of terms).
- Iterates over each item (polynomial) in the `result` list.
- Converts the current polynomial to a list of terms using the `add_polynomials` function and stores it in the `temp` variable.
- Checks if the set of terms in `temp` is equal to the set of terms in `globalsum`. If they are not equal, it prints `False` and returns `False`.
- If the sets are equal, it continues to the next polynomial.
- Finally, if all polynomials have the same terms, it prints `True` and returns `True`.

1. The `magic` function is called with the `result` list as an argument.

You can call your favored matric by just putting the matrix name in `extract_all` function.

**Julia**

1. The code defines a Julia function `parser(expr)` that parses and extracts terms from a given expression using regular expressions. The function is similar to the Python `parser` function but with some modifications to match the Julia syntax.
2. The `add_polynomials` function in Julia is very similar to its Python counterpart. It combines a list of polynomials into a single polynomial, where each term is represented by a tuple of coefficient and variable. The main difference is in the syntax and built-in types used in Julia.
3. The `extract_columns` function in Julia extracts columns from a matrix. The implementation is similar to the Python code, but with syntax differences. Julia uses 1-based indexing by default, and the `Vector` type is used to represent arrays.
4. The `extract_rows` function in Julia extracts rows from a matrix. It is identical to the Python code, but again, with syntax differences.
5. The `extract_diagonals` function in Julia extracts the main and secondary diagonals from a matrix. The implementation is similar to the Python code, but with some minor syntax differences.
6. The `extract_all` function in Julia combines the extracted columns, rows, and diagonals into a single list. It is similar to the Python code, but with syntax differences.
7. The `magic` function in Julia checks if the extracted matrix is a magic square. It is similar to the Python code, but with syntax differences. Julia uses `println` instead of `print` to display output.
8. The Julia code defines `input_matrix_false` and `input_matrix_true` matrices, which represent examples of matrices with different properties.
9. The Julia code calls the necessary functions and displays the result using `println`.

Overall, the logic and functionality of the code are similar in both Python and Julia versions. The main differences lie in the syntax and some built-in types used in each language.

**Swift**

1. `parser(_ expr: String) -> [[Any]]`: This function takes a polynomial expression as input and parses it into a 2D array representation. It uses regular expressions to match and extract coefficients and variables from the expression. The parsed terms are stored as arrays of `[coefficient, variable]` pairs. The function returns the parsed terms as a 2D array.
2. `addPolynomials(_ polynomials: [String]) -> [(Int, String)]`: This function takes an array of polynomial expressions as input and performs polynomial addition. It calls the `parser` function to parse each polynomial into terms, and then combines the terms by summing the coefficients for each variable. The function returns the combined terms as an array of `(coefficient, variable)` tuples.
3. `extractColumns(_ matrix: [[String]]) -> [[String]]`: This function takes a matrix of polynomial expressions as input and extracts the columns of the matrix. It iterates over the columns of the matrix and builds a new matrix where each column is represented as an array of polynomial expressions.
4. `extractRows(_ matrix: [[String]]) -> [[String]]`: This function takes a matrix of polynomial expressions as input and simply returns the matrix as it is, representing the rows.
5. `extractDiagonals(_ matrix: [[String]]) -> [[String]]`: This function takes a matrix of polynomial expressions as input and extracts the main diagonal and secondary diagonal of the matrix. It iterates over the matrix and extracts the corresponding elements from each diagonal, storing them in separate arrays.
6. `extractAll(_ matrix: [[String]]) -> [[String]]`: This function takes a matrix of polynomial expressions as input and uses the `extractColumns`, `extractRows`, and `extractDiagonals` functions to extract all the elements from the matrix. It returns a new matrix where each element is represented as a polynomial expression.
7. `magic(result: [[String]]) -> Bool`: This function takes the result matrix as input and checks if it represents a magic square. It first calls the `addPolynomials` function on the first row of the matrix to get the global sum of coefficients for each variable. Then, it iterates over the remaining rows and calls `addPolynomials` on each row. If the set of variables and coefficients obtained from each row is not equal to the global sum, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.
8. `areEqualSets(_ set1: [(Int, String)], _ set2: [(Int, String)]) -> Bool`: This helper function compares two sets of `(coefficient, variable)` tuples and checks if they are equal. It first checks if the count of tuples in both sets is equal, and then compares the sets based on the variables.
